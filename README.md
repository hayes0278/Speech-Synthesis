## Limitations
- There is no input checking and sanitation performed either client or server side.
- This project is more Windows server focused, instead of being more platform agnostic.
- The necessary code to be placed in a production environment is not present.

## Retrospective
- More domain and platform research should have been completed in the beginning.
